Installation:
  $ bundle install
  $ rake db:create
  $ rake db:migrate

Admin view:
  /admin/products
  /admin/categories

PublicView:

constraints and assumptions:

  - First we need to create category then sub_category then sub_sub_category.
  - Product can be added to only sub_sub_category. That will internally add the product to respective category and sub_category.
